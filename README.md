# ArduinoRotaryEncoderLED
### Arduino code for RGB LED lights managed by a knob switch / button (rotary encoder)
<hr>

&emsp;The code features 9 modes of color coice: white, blue, red, green, blend all RGB / custom shade, red dim, green dim, blue dim, purple dim. 

&emsp;Each color can be adjusted by turning the knob to adjust the value by bits for each color.

  &emsp;One: green to blue range 
  
  &emsp;Two: blue to red range
  
  &emsp;Three: red to green range
  
  &emsp;Four: custom color picker / all colors
  
  &emsp;Five: red dimmable range
  
  &emsp;Six: green dimmable range
  
  &emsp;Seven: blue dimmable range
  
  &emsp;Eight: purple dimmable range
  
## Rotary Switch / Encoder Functions:
<hr>

  &emsp;Button Press: changes modes
  
  &emsp;Knob Twisting: adjusts hue and brightness on dimmables

### Future Additions:
<br/> - breathing / pulsating animations
<br/> - flash animations
<br/> - time adjustable modes
<br/> - other button types integration
